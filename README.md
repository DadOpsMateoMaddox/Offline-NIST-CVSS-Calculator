**CVSS Calculator - README**

**Overview**

This Python program is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool built using Tkinter that calculates the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score based on user-selected vulnerability metrics. 

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), which is a widely used framework for assessing the severity of security vulnerabilities. The specific methodology, including the metrics and calculations, follows the CVSS standards set by the FIRST.org (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams), which maintains the official CVSS specifications.

One commonly used online version of a CVSS calculator is hosted on the NVD (National Vulnerability Database) website by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which implements the CVSS system for vulnerability scoring: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss

It allows users to select various metrics like Access Vector, Access Complexity, Authentication, Confidentiality Impact, Integrity Impact, and Availability Impact. The program then calculates the CVSS score, helping assess the severity of a security vulnerability.

**Functionality**

The program calculates the CVSS base score using the following metrics:

1. **Access Vector (AV)**: The proximity required for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability.
2. **Access Complexity (AC)**: The complexity of conditions that must be met to exploit the vulnerability.
3. **Authentication (Au)**: The authentication needed for the attacker to exploit the vulnerability.
4. **Confidentiality Impact (C)**: The impact on the confidentiality of the affected system if the vulnerability is exploited.
5. **Integrity Impact (I)**: The impact on the integrity of the affected system.
6. **Availability Impact (A)**: The impact on the availability of the affected system.

The impact and exploitability are calculated using specific weightings for each metric, and the final base score is calculated using a formula. The result is displayed in the GUI.

**Key Features**

- Real-time CVSS score calculation upon metric selection.
- Simple, intuitive interface using combo boxes for metric selection.
- Hover tooltips for each metric to explain their purpose.
- Caps the CVSS score at a maximum of 10.

**How to Use**

1. Run the program in a Python environment with the necessary dependencies installed (see "Installation" below).
2. A window will appear with fields for each of the CVSS metrics.
3. For each metric (AV, AC, Au, C, I, A), use the dropdowns to select the appropriate value.
4. The CVSS score will automatically be recalculated and displayed at the bottom of the window each time a selection is made.
5. Tooltips will show when hovering over each dropdown field, explaining the metric.

**Installation**

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies:
bash
 
pip install pillow
3. Run the script:
bash
 
python cvss\_calculator.py

**Limitations**

1. **Offline Use Only**: This tool doesn't connect to any external databases or APIs. It's strictly for offline calculations of CVSS scores based on static weights.
2. **Metric Weights**: The weightings used for the calculations are simplified and hardcoded into the script. These might not reflect real-time updates to the official CVSS scoring system.
3. **No Temporal or Environmental Metrics**: This tool only calculates the base score. It doesn't account for temporal or environmental metrics, which are important in assessing the complete impact of a vulnerability.
4. **No Persistence**: The program does not save any calculations. Every time the tool is closed, the data is lost.
5. **Basic Interface**: The UI is functional but simple, with limited customization and styling options.

**Future Improvements**

- Add options for **Temporal** and **Environmental** metrics to provide a more comprehensive CVSS score.
- Improve user interface design for better usability and aesthetics.
- Allow users to export the calculated CVSS score to a file.
- Provide updates for dynamic metric weights based on official CVSS guidelines.

**Dependencies**

- **Tkinter**: Used to build the GUI.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Required for image manipulation (though currently not heavily used in the program).

**Conclusion**

This program provides a convenient offline method for calculating CVSS base scores with an easy-to-use graphical interface. While it offers real-time score updates based on selected vulnerability metrics, it is limited to basic CVSS scoring and doesn't cover temporal or environmental factors.
